This repository contains the implementation of a comparative analysis of methods for identifying Eulerian paths and cycles in graphs, with an emphasis on evaluating the Naïve and Tarjan approaches for bridge identification. The project applies these methods to Fleury’s Algorithm, a well-known algorithm in graph theory.
