This repository contains a Java implementation of a comparative analysis of methods for identifying Eulerian paths and cycles in graphs, with an emphasis on evaluating the Naïve and Tarjan approaches for bridge identification. The project applies these methods to Fleury’s Algorithm, a well-known algorithm in graph theory.

This implementation was developed as an assignment for the Graph Theory and Computability course, during the fourth semester of the Software Engineering program at PUC Minas. The complete assignment description is available in `assets/assignment.pdf`.
